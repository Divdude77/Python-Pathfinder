# Python-Pathfinder

A pathfinding algorithm I designed completely by myself using Python.
### Note: 
This is NOT a shortest pathfinding algorithm, just a correct path. I am working on finding the shortest path, and hope to add it soon.

## USAGE:

The map is stored in file called *map.txt* stored in the same directory as *main.py*. The walls can be made with any character, preferably # or â–ˆ, but the paths have to be whitespaces. The start and end points are denoted by O and X respectively. 

To easily make mazes, you can use https://www.dcode.fr/maze-generator. Make sure that the *Path Design* option is set to empty space and *Display* option is set to single character.

The *Samples* folder contains various sample maps with different sizes and designs. If using them, make sure to drag the file to the root directory and rename it to *map.txt*. Feel free to move the start and end points to see different paths formed.
